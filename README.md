# Matlab/Octave Code for CILP
code for neuro-symbolic integration, following 
Artur S. d'Avila Garcez, Krysia Broda and Dov M. Gabbay. Neural-Symbolic Learning Systems: Foundations and Applications, Perspectives in Neural Computing, Springer-Verlag, ISBN 1-85233-512-2, 2002. 

The code is based on Matlab/Octave Code for Artificial Neural Networks

Simple neural network code written in pure Octave/Matlab inspired by [Andrew Ng](http://andrewng.com)'s [Machine Learning Course on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/welcome).

The code for training a neural network is surprisingly concise, only a dozen lines of code or so (see `nn_train.m` and `nn_predict.m`).

To get octave on MacOS, use `brew install octave`.

To run the demos,

```
$ octave demo1.m
$ octave demo2.m
$ octave demo_cilp.m
```
